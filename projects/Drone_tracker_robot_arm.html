        <h1>Drone Tracking Robot Arm</h1>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project was to design and develop a <strong>Drone Tracking Robot Arm</strong> that uses computer vision to track the movement of a drone with onboard ArUco tags. The robot arm, constructed with AX-12A servos and the "Trossen" robot package, repositions itself to continuously point toward the drone. This innovation enhances the ability to record video footage of fast-moving objects efficiently and safely in various industrial and operational scenarios.</p>

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>This system augments human capability by providing a safer and more efficient method to record fast-moving objects in real-time. It has applications in industrial monitoring, surveillance, and beyond.</p>

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <h3>The Controller</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Further development of the controller is required, specifically tuning the PID gains.</li>
            <li>Address steady-state error by incorporating an integral term and balancing it with a derivative term to enhance response time, stability, and accuracy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>GPS Integration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorporate GPS tracking to complement camera data for better results.</li>
            <li>The current system does not include GPS, which would provide an additional layer of accuracy and robustness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Camera Enhancements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrate optical zoom functionality to improve video quality and tracking precision.</li>
            <li>Leverage existing code to detect ArUco tag size and map it to the device's optical zoom for enhanced visuals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Robot Arm Components: AX-12A servos and Trossen Robotics Kit.</li>
            <li>Computer Vision: Used OpenCV and ArUco markers for tracking.</li>
            <li>Control System: Initial implementation of a PID controller for arm movement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Drone Tracking Robot Arm</strong> lays the groundwork for advanced tracking systems with potential for further optimization and real-world deployment. Enhancements such as improved controller design, GPS integration, and optical zoom will increase its applicability and effectiveness across diverse domains.</p>
