                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Scheduling tasks for multiple robots with diverse
                    capabilities can be challenging. This challenge arises as these
                    robots collaborate under precedence constraints, especially
                    
                    when environmental demands require certain robots to handle heavier workloads. This complexity is compounded when
                    
                    human intervention is needed to allocate limited resources. To
                    address this, we introduce the Demand-Aware multi-Robot Task
                    
                    Scheduling (DARTS) approach, employing a multi-agent multi-
                    armed bandit framework to estimate environmental demand.
                    
                    We conducted a mixed reality based user study to investigate how human perception influences task scheduling and
                    
                    personalize the resource allocation process. To evaluate the
                    effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a comprehensive
                    benchmarking analysis focusing on multi-robot planning and
                    scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
                    DARTS approach outperforms rate-monotonic scheduling and
                    is comparable to state-of-the-art scheduling methods in terms
                    of robot waiting time, task completion time, and demand-aware
                    performance metrics. Our findings of user study indicate that
                    human task schedulers demonstrated improved performance in
                    scenarios involving autonomous agent assistance compared to
                    situations with lesser autonomy of the robotic systems.</p><br>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Multi-robot systems are effective in enhancing task efficiency and scalability by distributing the workload among
                    
                    multiple robots, enabling parallel execution of tasks, and
                    facilitating collaboration and coordination among the robots.
                    In recent years such systems gained popularity due to their
                    potential in various applications such as emergency rescue
                    and care, surveying, manufacturing and logistics as reported
                    by Rajan et al. [1]. Nonetheless, these robotic systems
                    may not possess the robustness to autonomously handle all
                    tasks, necessitating either human involvement within the loop
                    or human supervision, as elucidated by Nahavandi et al.
                    [2]. Achieving efficient task planning, scheduling, motion
                    planning, and control while preserving mission objectives
                    can be intricate, especially in the context of multi-robot
                    systems that involve human intervention, which brings its
                    own set of distinctive challenges. Goodrich et al. [3] explored
                    the spectrum of human-robot interactions and the intricacies
                    
                    within human-supervised and human-in-the loop robotic systems.<br><br>
                    
                    In a mixed reality based user study involving eight
                    participants (six male and two female), we investigated
                    the influence of human perception on human-supervised resource allocation. This study encompassed various sce-
                    narios, including independent scheduling, autonomous agent
                    
                    assistance, and simulated scheduling environments. The user
                    study enables us to achieve a deeper understanding of
                    human preferences, facilitating further customization of the
                    resource allocation process. Another significant contribu-
                    tion is the introduction of the Demand-Aware multi-Robot
                    Task Scheduling (DARTS) approach, which addresses multi-
                    robot task scheduling by taking into account environmental
                    demands and precedence constraints, promoting effective
                    collaboration and coordination among robots.
                     Environmental demand estimation is achieved through a multi-agent multi-
                    armed bandit approach, as elucidated by Sandula et al. [4].<br><br>
                    
                    In this context, the DARTS approach utilizes the bandit solver
                    to frame the task scheduling problem as a multi-armed bandit
                    problem, considering the precedence constraints among robot
                    coalitions.
                    Human-robot interaction can be classified into two primary
                    categories. The first category is human-in-the-loop (HIL)
                    [5]–[9], where a human operator actively collaborates with
                    or controls the robot during task execution. The second
                    category is human-on-the-loop (HOL) [10]–[12] interaction,
                    where a human operator supervises the task performed by
                    the robotic system. Our research centers on HOL robotic
                    
                    systems, with a particular emphasis on human task scheduling for multi-robot systems.<br><br>
                    
                    The literature on robotics has
                    
                    investigated task scheduling in various scenarios for both
                    single [13]–[15] and multi robot [7], [16]–[21] systems.
                    Previous studies have investigated task scheduling for a
                    single and multiple robot task scheduling in applications
                    industrial automation, assembling, and palletizing tasks etc.
                    Dhanaraj et al. [7] have proposed a human-in-the-loop task
                    scheduling with focus on fault recovery. Zhang et al. [21]
                    proposed heuristic based task scheduling approaches for a
                    
                    generalized scenario where robots form a coalition to accomplish a task. However, a human-on-the-loop demand aware
                    
                    scheduling strategy considering the precedence constraints
                    is not investigated in the current literature. Therefore, to
                    address this gap, we introduce a novel approach: DARTS
                    - a Demand-Aware multi-Robot Task Scheduling algorithm.
                    This algorithm leverages a multi-agent multi-armed bandit
                    [22] framework, as elucidated by Sandula et al. [4], to
                    estimate environmental demand.<br><br>
                    In brief, our research makes two notable contributions.
                    First, we propose a novel approach known as DARTS
                    
                    (Demand-Aware multi-Robot Task Scheduling) for multi-
                    robot task scheduling. This approach takes into account
                    
                    environmental demand and precedence constraints, and we have conducted a comprehensive benchmarking analysis to
                    evaluate its effectiveness. Second, we have conducted a
                    mixed reality based user study to investigate how human
                    perception influences human-guided task scheduling. We
                    observed that human task schedulers demonstrated improved
                    
                    performance in scenarios involving autonomous agent assis-
                    tance compared to situations with lesser autonomy of the
                    
                    robotic systems.</p><br>

                    <p>We conducted the user study to understand how human
                        perception effects the task scheduling in a human-on-the-
                        loop robotic system. Hence, we used a mixed-reality setup
                        
                        to create a realistic warehouse scenario for a pickup-dispatch
                        
                        task. The user study has three distinct scenarios. These scenarios encompassed (1) Single-robot scheduling, (2) Multi-
                        robot scheduling, and (3) Simulated scheduling with zero
                        
                        robots, each of which is described below. We collected data
                        from all the participants across all the scenarios.<br><br>
                        1. Material: We established a mixed reality environment
                        by utilizing Microsoft Hololens [28], Unity [29], Turtlebot
                        [30] and ROS [31] platforms. In this environment, we
                        introduced three distinct scenarios aimed at investigating the
                        influence of human perception on task scheduling.<br><br>
                        2. Participants: We enlisted 8 participants (6 males, 2
                        females) from our university, with an average age of 24.37
                        
                        years and a standard deviation of 2.99. None of the participants had color blindness, and they all granted the required
                        
                        permissions and consent for the study.<br><br>
                        3. Setup: In case 1, known as single-robot scheduling
                        (depicted in Figure 3), participants are assigned the operation
                        of a single robot and tasked with deducing rewards to
                        maximize their collection. Participants control the robots
                        using the virtual buttons, and when a robot reaches a
                        designated station, the reward obtained is revealed in green text atop the station. During this phase, we measure the
                        distance travelled by robot, record task completion times, and
                        calculate the rewards achieved in each iteration. The rewards
                        in each iteration are calculated based on specific probability
                        distributions unique to each station, all of which are kept
                        confidential from the participants. This information remains
                        undisclosed throughout the study.
                        In case 2, known as multi-robot scheduling, as shown in
                        the Figure 4 we introduce an autonomous agent into the
                        environment. Here, participants observe the actions of the
                        autonomous agent and have the option to incorporate its
                        strategies into their own task scheduling. This stage serves
                        
                        to compare participant performance when acting indepen-
                        dently versus when assisted by the autonomous agent. The
                        
                        autonomous agent utilizes the DARTS algorithm for task
                        scheduling. In this environment, two rewards are displayed:
                        one collected by the autonomous agent (yellow colour)
                        and the other by the user-controlled robot. Participants can
                        utilize the reward data of agent to optimize their scheduling
                        processes.
                        In the case 3, referred to as simulated scheduling with
                        zero robots, the mixed reality setup remains identical to
                        the previous cases. However, it lacks physical robots, and
                        participants instantly observe rewards upon interacting with
                        virtual buttons.<br><br>
                        4. Design: The user interface, depicted in figures 3 and
                        4, features five virtual buttons for task scheduling. For cases
                        1 and 2, each button when pressed, the tele-operated robot
                        executes a pickup-dispatch task. The robot autonomously
                        navigates first to the base location and subsequently to the
                        corresponding station. Upon task completion, a reward is
                        displayed on the respective station. For the tele-operated
                        robot, the reward is shown in green text, while for the

                        <p>The user study has three distinct conditions: (1) Single-
                            robot (no autonomous Agent), (2) Multi-robot scheduling
                            
                            (with autonomous agent) and (3) Simulated scheduling envi-
                            ronment with no robots as explained in Section III-C. In total,
                            
                            each participant was responsible for scheduling 45 tasks: 15
                            tasks independently in case 1, 15 tasks with the assistance of
                            the autonomous agent in case 2 and additionally, participants
                            completed 15 tasks in a simulated environment where there
                            was no robot involved, and the reward was instantly observed
                            by the user.</p>
                            <p>Our analysis encompassed three distinct aspects It may be noted from figures 7 and 9, it becomes evident
                            that users generally prioritized lower rewards as a means
                            to minimize the overall distance traveled by the robots,
                            particularly in case 1. The exception to this trend was user
                            
                            4. However, in scenarios where scheduling involved au-
                            tonomous agent assistance, users exhibited improved perfor-
                            mance in terms of rewards and seemed less concerned about
                            
                            the distance traveled by the robots. Additionally, we noted
                            that there was no substantial difference in user performance
                            regarding rewards between cases 1 and 3.
                            
                            From Figure 8, it is clear that participants favored com-
                            pleting tasks quickly over optimal scheduling in independent
                            
                            scheduling (Case 1). However, in Case 2, with autonomous
                            agent assistance, participants took more time to complete
                            tasks while achieving higher rewards.
                            Figure 9 reveals scheduling preferences of the participants.
                            In case 1, they sought to minimize the travel distance of
                            robot, deeming it efficient. In contrast, Case 2 presented
                            a different scenario. Here, the autonomous agent employed
                            
                            the DARTS algorithm. Participants shifted their focus to-
                            ward maximizing rewards. They made this adjustment after
                            
                            observing the rewards acquired by the autonomous agent,
                            even if it meant the robot had to cover a greater distance.Remarkably, in case 2, the robot covered significantly more
                            distance compared to case 1, except for user 4. </p>

    <p>We performed a one-way ANOVA to compare the total rewards of users across three cases: 1, 2, and 3. This analysis did not reveal any statistically significant differences.

    However, when we performed paired T-tests on other dependent variables, namely total task completion time and total distance traveled by the tele-operated robot, we observed statistical significance among the cases 1 and 2.

    A paired T-test score for total task completion time indicates that the users took more time to complete the tasks in case 2, while case 1 is significantly lower ( \(t = -4.693, p < 0.050, Cohen's d = -1.369\) ) than case 2.

    The paired T-test score for total distance traveled by the tele-operated robot indicates that the tele-operated robot traveled a significantly longer distance to complete the tasks in case 2, while case 1 is significantly lower ( \(t = -2.759, p < 0.050, Cohen's d = -0.787\) ) than case 2.

    In conclusion, the data suggests that there are significant differences between the means of distances traveled by the tele-operated robot and the time taken by users across the different cases.</p>

<p>In summary, participants initially prioritized task comple-
    tion speed and minimizing travel distance when scheduling
    
    tasks independently. However, when an autonomous agent
    was introduced, task scheduling improved, resulting in higher
    rewards but with increased time consumption. Participants
    also learned that minimizing robot travel distance did not
    always yield the best task scheduling outcomes, a finding
    supported by statistical analysis.</p>

    <h2>Future Work and Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Extensive benchmarking demonstrated
        that DARTS performed competitively with state-of-the-art
        algorithms and outperformed the rate-monotonic scheduling
        approach in terms of demand-aware performance [4], task
        
        completion times, and robot waiting times. The mixed reality user study emphasized the benefits of integrating an
        
        autonomous agent into human-on-the-loop multi-robot task
        
        scheduling. Future work will focus on demand-aware multi-
        robot task allocation with human supervision.</p>
