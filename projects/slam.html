                <h5>Gaussian Splatting SLAM</h5>
                <div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 24px;">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DzUyQrOvBzU?si=wMI06etzzoPwu8an" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>

                <p>Gaussian Splatting SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a novel approach that integrates Gaussian Splatting, a method for efficiently representing 3D environments, with SLAM techniques. Gaussian Splatting involves representing the environment as a set of Gaussian distributions or "splats," which are compact, probabilistic models that describe the appearance and geometry of small regions in space. These splats are typically placed at various points in the environment and collectively provide a dense, continuous representation of the scene.

                  In SLAM, the goal is to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously tracking the position of the sensor (often a robot or camera) within that environment. Gaussian Splatting SLAM combines these goals by using the Gaussian splats not only to represent the map but also to assist in localization. The Gaussian splats provide a rich, detailed representation of the environment, which can improve the accuracy of both the mapping and the localization processes.<br><br>
                  
                  Key advantages of Gaussian Splatting SLAM include:<br>
                  
                  1. <b>Efficiency:</b> The use of Gaussian splats allows for a compact and efficient representation of large-scale environments, which can be crucial for real-time applications.<br>
                  
                  2. <b>Detail:</b> Gaussian splats can represent fine details in the environment, improving the quality of the map and the precision of localization.<br>
                  
                  3. <b>Robustness:</b> The probabilistic nature of Gaussian splats can provide robustness to noise and uncertainties in the sensor data.<br><br>
                  
                 <b><i>Gaussian Splatting SLAM is particularly suited for scenarios where high-resolution, continuous maps are needed, such as in autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. It represents a step forward in combining advanced 3D representation techniques with SLAM methodologies, leading to more accurate and reliable environmental mapping and localization.</i></b> </p>

                 <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                 <p>In conclusion, Gaussian Splatting proved to be the most effective approach, as demonstrated in the videos. This is due to the superior 3D reconstruction it provides, thanks to the high-quality point cloud data generated by the Structure from Motion (SFM) model. Additionally, we integrated data from the Depth Anything model to achieve seamless localization. Among the three approaches, GS SLAM emerged as the best. Furthermore, we ensured ROS compatibility for all three SLAM methods.</p>
